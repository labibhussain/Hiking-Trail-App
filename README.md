# YelpCamp
<h2>A node.js web application project from Colt Steele's Udemy Course.</h2>
<p>A web application that allows users to log in, upload, and review different campgrounds using MongoDB, ExpressJS, and other node frameworks.</p>
<p>In order to reinvent the project as my own, I implemented a 'upvote' system to keep track of most popular campgrounds.<p>
<p>Reinforces RESTful routing, Authentication/Authorization, Data Associations, and other back-end techniques. Also uses Bootstrap framework to make a responsive web design. </p>
